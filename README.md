Welcome to my inaugural GitHub project! This project simplifies operations for automobile service stations. The inspiration to make this project comes from my father who works in the automobile industry.
Key Features of this project are
Customer Data Management,
Receipt Generation,
Issue Tracking and Reporting and
User Authentication.
The code is written in Python and uses MySQL in the backend.

**Since, I come from the ECE background this project is very basic as I was trying to implement my newly learnt skill somewhere. It had a lot of errors in the beginning and so I have taken help of various online sources to make it better.
