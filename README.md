Welcome to my inaugural GitHub project! I created this during my 4th semester of bachelor's studies, this project simplifies operations for automobile service stations. The inspiration to make this project comes from my father who works in the automobile industry.
Key Features of this project are :
Customer Data Management: Streamlined organization for customer information.
Receipt Generation: Effortless creation of professional receipts.
Issue Tracking and Reporting: Comprehensive documentation of vehicle issues.
User Authentication: Secure login/signup for authorized access.
The code is written in Python and uses MySQL in the backend.
**Since, I come from the ECE background this project is very basic as I was trying to implement my newly learnt skill somewhere. It had a lot of errors in the beginning and so I have taken help of various sources online to make it better.
